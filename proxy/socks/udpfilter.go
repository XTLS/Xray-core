In the sock implementation of * ray, UDP authentication is flawed and can be bypassed.
Tracking a UDP connection may be a bit troublesome.
Here is a simple solution.
We create a filter, add remote IP to the pool when it try to establish a UDP connection with auth.
And drop UDP packets from unauthorized IP.
After discussion, we believe it is not necessary to add a timeout mechanism to this filter.
