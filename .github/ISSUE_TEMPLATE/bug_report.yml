        ## Configuration and Log Section
        
        ### For config
        Please provide the configuration files that can reproduce the problem, including the server and client.
        Don't just paste a big exported config file here. Eliminate useless inbound/outbound, rules, options, this can help determine the problem, if you really want to get help.

        ### For logs
        Please set the log level to debug and dnsLog to true first.
        Restart Xray-core, then operate according to the reproduction method, try to reduce the irrelevant part in the log.
        Remember to delete parts with personal information (such as UUID and IP).
        Provide the log of Xray-core, not the log output by the panel or other things.

        ### Finally
        After removing parts that do not affect reproduction, provide the actual running **complete** file, do not only provide inbound or outbound or a few lines of logs based on your own judgment.
        Put the content between the preset ```<details><pre><code>``` ```</code></pre></details>``` in the text box.
        If the problem is very clear that only related to one end (such as core startup failure/crash after correctly writing the config according to the documents), N/A can be filled in for unnecessary areas below.
