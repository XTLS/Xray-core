// Package core provides an entry point to use Xray core functionalities.
//
// Xray makes it possible to accept incoming network connections with certain
// protocol, process the data, and send them through another connection with
// the same or a difference protocol on demand.
//
// It may be configured to work with multiple protocols at the same time, and
// uses the internal router to tunnel through different inbound and outbound
// connections.
