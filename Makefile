# NOTE: This MAKEFILE can be used to build Xray-core locally and in Automatic workflows. It is \
	provided for convenience in automatic building and functions as a part of it.
# NOTE: If you need to modify this file, please be aware that:\
	- This file is not the main Makefile; it only accepts environment variables and builds the \
	binary.\
	- Automatic building expects the correct binaries to be built by this Makefile. If you \
	intend to propose a change to this Makefile, carefully review the file below and ensure \
	that the change will not accidentally break the automatic building:\
		.github/workflows/release.yml \
	Otherwise it is recommended to contact the project maintainers.
